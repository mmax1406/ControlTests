# ControlTests
Testing some control schemes of  control problems. 
(Each sub-project has a pdf with an explanation of whats done - or at least will have one)

### Pendulum control
Using matlabs simscape deploying 2 control schemes.
1) classical PID (no cascade loop closure) 
2) ADRC control

### BLDC motor control
My tests of controlling the simscape bldc motor model using diffrenet control schemes. (Still working on it and making a clearer explanation).
Need to add the inverter

### Kalman
My implemntation of a kalman filter for a pendulum model. I compared it to the simulink implemntation on a mathworks example.
